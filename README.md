Overview
Businesses collect vast amounts of sales data, but raw data alone provides little actionable insight. To make informed decisions, companies need to analyze and visualize sales trends, revenue patterns, and product demand fluctuations over time.

Problem Definition
The challenge is to analyze sales data and generate visual insights that help answer key business questions such as:

What is the total revenue generated over a specific period?
Which products are in high demand, and which ones are underperforming?
How do sales vary across different seasons or months?
Objectives
Revenue Analysis – Understand how revenue changes over time and identify peak revenue periods.
Product Demand Trends – Determine which products are selling the most and least.
Seasonal Sales Patterns – Identify seasonal trends in sales to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
